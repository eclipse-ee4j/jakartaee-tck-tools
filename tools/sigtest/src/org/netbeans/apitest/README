@(#)README	1.2 99/02/16

These files are from the JCK test suite, and shouldn't be directly modified.
If a bug needs to be fixed in them, it should be fixed in the JCK source
and then the updated file copied into this directory.  (This is why the
SCCS ID values are stored.)

Full instructions on how to run this test can be found in the
APIChangesTest.java file.  Here are some simple examples:

    To create a signature file:
        java javasoft.sqe.tests.api.APIChangesTest -TestURL file://`pwd`/ \
             -Filename mySignatureFile -setup

    To run the test with that signature file:
        java javasoft.sqe.tests.api.APIChangesTest -TestURL file://`pwd`/ \
             -Filename mySignatureFile
