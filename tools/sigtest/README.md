# SigTest

*SigTest* is the tool for checking incompatibilities between different versions of the same API. 
It is possible to use it as a Maven plugin or an Ant task to check for binary backward 
compatibility and mutual signature compatibility. The tool is known to work with JDK8 and JDK11 and
is used by many projects including [Graal](https://github.com/oracle/graal/commit/6ca3d0458d108ba183997f09fa51596fbe503893#diff-6229fdf88aa48f7dda4de6126283c913),
[Hibernate](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/pull/831/files) and 
Apache [NetBeans](https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans/pull/670).

## Use in Maven

The [Maven Plugin](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|a%3A%22sigtest-maven-plugin%22) is available 
on Maven central thus it is easily embeddable it into your own project. 

### Generate the Signature File

The first thing to do is to generate snapshot of API of your library - 
e.g. the signature file. Just add following into your own `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.netbeans.tools</groupId>
  <artifactId>sigtest-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.3</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>generate</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  <configuration>
    <packages>org.yourcompany.app.api,org.yourcompany.help.api</packages>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

with just this change the API of your classes is going to be recorded 
into a `.sigtest` file and included as an secondary artefact of your project
when you invoke `mvn install`.

For example libraries of [Apache Html/Java API](https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-html4j/) have their 
sigtest files attached in [Maven central](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/netbeans/html/net.java.html.json/1.3/)
with [this changeset](https://github.com/emilianbold/netbeans-html4j/commit/3474a45f6cd1352d2366ced976a12d7d6497bc09).


### Check Against Signature File in a Repository

Once the sigfile is part of a Maven repository, you want to check your new APIs against that 
API snapshot recorded previously to make sure you are not making *incompatible changes*.
Try the following:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.netbeans.tools</groupId>
  <artifactId>sigtest-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.3</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>check</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  <configuration>
    <packages>org.yourcompany.app.api,org.yourcompany.help.api</packages>
    <releaseVersion>1.3</releaseVersion>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

The difference is the goal - e.g. check and also the need to specify `releaseVersion` - that is the
identification of the previously released version of your library that you want to check 
compatibility against.

And that is all! To verify the setup is correct, try to remove a method or do some other
incompatible change. When I tried and executed `mvn install` I got a build failure

```bash
SignatureTest report
Base version: 1.3
Tested version: 2.0-SNAPSHOT
Check mode: bin [throws removed]
Constant checking: on
 
 
Class net.java.html.json.Models
  "E1.2 - API type removed" : method public final static void net.java.html.json.Models.applyBindings(java.lang.Object,java.lang.String)
 
 
 
target/surefire-reports/sigtest/TEST-json-2.0-SNAPSHOT.xml: 1 failures in /.m2/repository/json/1.3/json-1.3.sigfile
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD FAILURE
```

This is the way [Apache Html/Java API](https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-html4j/) project
enabled signature its testing: see 
[changeset mixing both goals together](https://github.com/emilianbold/netbeans-html4j/commit/d3ef8e3208f2b04c85eafde97e4ccaf2cfe6d627).

### Fail on Error

You may want to control whether a failure in signature test should be fatal or not. Do it with:

```xml
  <configuration>
    <failOnError>false</failOnError>
 
    <packages>org.yourcompany.app.api,org.yourcompany.help.api</packages>
    <releaseVersion>1.3</releaseVersion>
  </configuration>
```  

With this configuration the test will be performed and output printed, but the build will go on.
This may be useful when one needs to do an incompatible change and wants to disable the check
until next version is published.

### Prevent Any Change

By default the plugin verifies there are no incompatible changes. However compatible changes
are allowed. Sometimes it is useful to prevent any changes altogether (when creating a bugfix release, for example), 
then try:

```xml
  <configuration>
    <action>strictcheck</action>
 
    <packages>org.yourcompany.app.api,org.yourcompany.help.api</packages>
    <releaseVersion>1.3</releaseVersion>
  </configuration>
```

with the action option set to `strictcheck` the plugin will detect any API change and fail even if it is compatible. 

## Relax verification of JDK signatures

There are some cases where avoiding the verification of certain JDK classes entirely or their signatures can improve the ability to verify your API on different JDK versions.
The `-IgnoreJDKClass` option can be used to specify a set of JDK classes that can benefit from relaxed signature verification rules when it comes to dealing with JDK 
specific signature changes introduced by a later JDK version. As an example, a Signature file with @java.lang.Deprecated annotations from JDK8 may be seeing verification failures on JDK9+ 
due to `default` fields being added to @Deprecated.  With `-IgnoreJDKClass java.lang.Deprecated` enabled, verification of the @Deprecated will only check that the tested class member has the 
@Deprecated class but no verification of the @Deprecated signature will be performed. 

## History

This tool is based on original [SigTest](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/CodeTools/sigtest) sources,
but has been adopted to suite the needs of a [NetBeans project](http://wiki.netbeans.org/SignatureTest). 
Since then it evolved into [general purpose tool](http://wiki.netbeans.org/SigTest). When NetBeans become
Apache project, Emilian Bold converted the [original Hg repository](http://hg.netbeans.org/apitest/) to
[Git repository](https://github.com/emilianbold/netbeans-apitest) to preserve the history. The development,
including support for JDK11, etc. now continues at following GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/jtulach/netbeans-apitest/).
